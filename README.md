# SHUBHAM-ROBOS

### [Live Demo](https://shubham-robos.web.app/)

### About App:

It is a Single Page Application demo built using ReactJs for searching the robots that is being fetched from external public api.

### Run Locally:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/ch-shubham/shubhamrobos.git
$ cd shubhamrobos
$ yarn
$ yarn run
```

- yarn is preferred over npm but we can use both.

### Things I tried on this app:

- Used Class based as well as functional based component.
- Used google font for font-family.
- Used lifecycle Methods to fetch user from external API.
- Used promises with help of Async/Await as well as .then().catch()
- Deployed my ROBOTS to firebase hosting.

### Future Plans:

- Write Unit Test Cases for the components.
- Automate the deployment to firebase using Github Workflow actions.
- Add SonarQube for quality check.
